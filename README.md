# revolt-msnmessengertheme
Revolt Theme that tries to replicate the feel of older versions of MSN Messenger

This is a hobby project of mine. It's not meant to be an accurate emulation of MSN Messenger or anything like that.
Also ultimately all rights to the original programs this program tries to do a tribute to belong to their respective owners including Microsoft.
# notes
This theme uses the Microsoft fonts "Tahoma", "Trebuchet MS" and "MS Sans Serif". Due to the risky implications of including them here, 
you will have to get them on your own if they aren't installed on your computer to experience this theme like it was intended.

I might make a version with fallback fonts soon.

Also this theme is meant for the current Revite client and will absolutely not work in the upcoming one, nor it will work in third party ones if they have their own CSS theming support.
# installation
To install this theme like every other Revolt theme, go to Settings and click the Appearance slider, scrolldown until you see "Theme Overrides". First copy the elements inside "msn messenger revolt full theme.txt" and then clcik the "Import a theme button to paste theme". This theme should work correctly.
