# revolt-msnmessengertheme
Revolt Theme that tries to replicate the feel of older versions of MSN Messenger
This is a hobby project of mine. It's not meant to be an accurate emulation of MSN Messenger or anything like that.
Also ultimately all rights to the original programs this program tries to do a tribute to belong to their respective owners including Microsoft.
# notes
This theme uses the Microsoft fonts "Tahoma", "Trebuchet MS" and "MS Sans Serif". Due to the risky implications of including them here, 
you will have to get them on your own if they aren't installed on your computer to experience this theme like it was intended.
I might make a version with fallback fonts soon.
